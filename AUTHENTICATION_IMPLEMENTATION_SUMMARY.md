## 🔑 Key Behaviors

### For Anonymous (Guest) Users:
- ✅ Auto-created on first app launch
- ✅ Persistent session across app restarts
- ✅ Can use all app features immediately
- ✅ Can purchase premium without email
- ✅ See "Add Email to Sync" prompts
- ❌ **Cannot sign out** (prevents data loss)
- ℹ️ Data saved locally, can be synced by adding email

### For Authenticated Users:
- ✅ Email displayed in profile
- ✅ Data synced across devices
- ✅ Can sign out safely
- ⚠️ Sign out creates new guest account
- ℹ️ Must sign in again to access old data

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Anonymous session not created on first launch
**Solution:** Check console logs for `ensureUserSession()` output. Verify Supabase credentials.

### Issue: Email linking fails
**Solution:** Check that user is actually anonymous (`isAnonymousUser == true`). Verify email format and password length.

### Issue: Data not showing after email link
**Solution:** Verify UUID remained same before/after linking. Check RLS policies in Supabase.

### Issue: Sign out not working for authenticated users
**Solution:** Check `isAnonymousUser` is false. Verify new anonymous session is created.
