# Functional Program Cards Implementation Guide

## Overview
The program cards have been successfully updated from static display components to fully functional interactive components with navigation and enrollment capabilities.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Functional Program Cards (`FunctionalProgramCard`)
- **Interactive**: Cards now respond to taps with custom actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Different styling for locked vs unlocked programs
- **Action Callbacks**: Each card can execute custom actions when tapped

### 2. Enhanced Program Section (`PremiumTrainingProgramsSection`)
- **Navigation**: Tapping program cards opens detailed program views
- **State Management**: Tracks selected programs and navigation state
- **Program Loading**: Automatically loads programs for premium users
- **Mock Data**: Uses mock programs for testing (easily replaceable with real data)

### 3. Program Detail View (`ProgramDetailView`)
- **Comprehensive Information**: Shows program details, difficulty, duration
- **Program Overview**: Displays key program information in organized sections
- **Sample Week Preview**: Shows what a typical week looks like
- **Enrollment Flow**: Allows users to enroll in programs with starting weight selection

### 4. Enrollment System (`ProgramEnrollmentView`)
- **Weight Selection**: Interactive slider for choosing starting ruck weight
- **Program Integration**: Connects with ProgramService for enrollment
- **User Guidance**: Provides recommendations for weight selection

### 5. Supporting Components
- **DifficultyBadge**: Color-coded difficulty indicators
- **ProgramOverviewSection**: Organized program information display
- **SampleWeekSection**: Preview of program structure
- **EnrollmentSection**: Call-to-action for program enrollment
- **EnrolledSection**: Status display for enrolled users

## Key Features

### For Premium Users
- ✅ **Full Access**: Can view all program details
- ✅ **Navigation**: Tap cards to see detailed program information
- ✅ **Enrollment**: Can enroll in programs with custom starting weights
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Shows enrollment status and progress options

### For Free Users
- ✅ **Preview Access**: Can see program cards but they're locked
- ✅ **Paywall Integration**: Tapping locked cards shows premium upgrade options
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Clear lock icons and premium badges

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```swift
// Use the ProgramTestView to test individual components
ProgramTestView()
```

### 2. Integration Test
The functional components are already integrated into the main app:
- `PhoneMainView.swift` uses `PremiumTrainingProgramsSection()`
- Components automatically adapt based on premium status
- Navigation and enrollment flows are fully functional

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Premium User Testing
1. **View Programs**: Should see 4 program cards (Military Foundation, Ranger Challenge, Selection Prep, Maintenance)
2. **Tap Program**: Should open detailed program view
3. **Enroll in Program**: Should show enrollment flow with weight selection
4. **Complete Enrollment**: Should show enrolled status

#### Free User Testing
1. **View Locked Programs**: Should see 2 locked program cards
2. **Tap Locked Program**: Should show paywall for premium upgrade
3. **Premium Overlay**: Should see premium feature overlay

## Code Structure

### Main Components
- `PremiumTrainingProgramsSection`: Main container with navigation logic
- `FunctionalProgramCard`: Interactive program cards
- `ProgramDetailView`: Detailed program information and enrollment
- `ProgramEnrollmentView`: Weight selection and enrollment flow

### Supporting Views
- `DifficultyBadge`: Program difficulty indicators
- `ProgramOverviewSection`: Program information display
- `SampleWeekSection`: Weekly program preview
- `EnrollmentSection`: Enrollment call-to-action
- `EnrolledSection`: Post-enrollment status

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **PremiumManager**: Controls access to premium features
- **ProgramService**: Handles program data and enrollment
- **Program Model**: Uses existing Program, UserProgram, and related models

### Navigation Flow
1. User sees program cards on main screen
2. Taps card → Opens ProgramDetailView
3. Taps "Start Program" → Opens ProgramEnrollmentView
4. Selects weight → Enrolls in program
5. Returns to detail view showing enrolled status

## Future Enhancements

### Easy to Extend
- **Dynamic Loading**: Replace mock programs with real data from ProgramService
- **Progress Tracking**: Add progress views for enrolled programs
- **Program Management**: Add ability to view/manage multiple enrollments
- **Custom Programs**: Allow users to create custom training programs

### Data Integration
- **Real Programs**: Connect to actual program database
- **User Progress**: Track and display program completion
- **Recommendations**: Suggest programs based on user fitness level

## Files Modified
- `PremiumIntegration.swift`: Updated with functional components
- `ProgramTestView.swift`: Created for testing (can be removed in production)

## Files That Use the Components
- `PhoneMainView.swift`: Main app view that displays the program section
- All views that need program functionality can import and use these components

The implementation is now fully functional and ready for testing program enrollment and navigation!
